# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²
This is a Python-based number guessing game created as part of my Software Development internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.

## How the Game Works:
- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- You will be prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback on whether your guess was too low or too high.
- The game continues until you guess the correct number, and it will tell you how many attempts you made!

## How to Play:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManisaiGondrala/PRODIGY_SD_02
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python Number_guessing.py
3. Follow the prompts to enter your guesses.
4. Have fun guessing!
